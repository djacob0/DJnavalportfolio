          I was born in the Philippines and currently reside in Quezon City. As an aspiring
          full-stack developer, I&apos;m passionate about building innovative and impactful
          digital solutions. I enjoy collaborating on new projectsâ€”whether
          creating a product, developing a feature, or solving complex
          challenges. Feel free to reach out if you&apos;re interested
          in working together or have any questions!
